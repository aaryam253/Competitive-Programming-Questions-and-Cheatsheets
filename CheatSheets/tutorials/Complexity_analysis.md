# Complexity analysis 

- Worst case time
- Just retain the largest power of each value 


## To analyse 
eg. F(n) n^2 vs G(n) = 2n^2 + 100000000n

Just take a = F(n)/G(n), apply lim(a), and see where it tends towards 

- If its constant then they are the same. 
- If it tends towards zero then F(n) is smaller


## Real life applications 

A computer can do about 10^8 operations per sec 

## Some examples 

Harmonic series = O(log n), (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...)
